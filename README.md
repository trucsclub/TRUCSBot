# TRU CS Club Bot

![Build Status](https://github.com/trucsclub/TRUCSBot/workflows/Build%20Status/badge.svg)

This is the official Discord bot for the TRUSU Computing Science Club Discord channel, which you can access [here](https://trucsclub.ca/discord). 

It uses the [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) library to interact with Discord. It also uses [IGDB .NET SDK](https://github.com/kamranayub/igdb-dotnet) for interacting with [IGDB.com](https://www.igdb.com/) for our Game Night recommendations. 

## Building

Build it like any other .NET Core project :)

## Running

You need to edit your settings file with your own Discord API key.

### Getting a Discord API Key

To get a Discord API key, you need to create an application on [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
